## Introduction

Darwinia Smart Chain is a substrate based ethereum compatible smart contract platform where contract developers can easily migrate
smart contracts from the Ethereum chain to run their business. In this article we will cover a number of topics that are important to contract developers, such as network configuration, pre-compiles and so on. In addition, we have set up a free test network, the pangoro network, where the latest features will be fully tested before they are added to the Darwinia Smart Chain. The user can go to [Pangoro Test Token Faucet](https://apps.darwinia.network/account), then switch to `Pangoro` to obtain test tokens.
